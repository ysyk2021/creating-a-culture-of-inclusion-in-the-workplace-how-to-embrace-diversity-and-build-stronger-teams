In order to create a culture of inclusion in the workplace, it's important to have a clear understanding of what inclusion means. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of inclusion, discuss the science behind inclusion, and offer strategies for assessing your personal approach to inclusion.

Overview of Inclusion
---------------------

Inclusion is the practice of creating a workplace culture that values diversity and fosters a sense of belonging among all employees. This includes recognizing and valuing differences such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, and sexual orientation. Inclusive workplaces promote equal opportunities for all employees to contribute and succeed, regardless of their background or identity.

Understanding the Science Behind Inclusion
------------------------------------------

The science behind inclusion shows that diverse and inclusive teams are more innovative, productive, and profitable than homogenous teams. Research has shown that diversity in teams can lead to better problem-solving, increased creativity, and improved decision-making. In addition, inclusive teams are more engaged, committed, and satisfied with their work.

Assessing Your Personal Approach to Inclusion
---------------------------------------------

Assessing your personal approach to inclusion is an important first step in building a culture of inclusion in the workplace. Strategies for assessing your personal approach to inclusion include:

* **Identifying Biases**: Identifying biases or assumptions you may hold can help you become more aware of your own perspective and help you recognize when those biases may be influencing your interactions with others.

* **Seeking Diverse Perspectives**: Seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences can help broaden your understanding of the world and foster empathy.

* **Examining Your Communication Style**: Examining your communication style, including nonverbal cues, tone, and language, can help ensure that you are promoting inclusivity in your interactions with others.

Conclusion
----------

Defining inclusion is essential for creating a workplace culture that values diversity and fosters a sense of belonging among all employees. By understanding the science behind inclusion and assessing your personal approach to inclusivity, you can become a more effective advocate for diversity and inclusion in your workplace. The key is to be intentional about prioritizing inclusion efforts and to work collaboratively to create a more inclusive and innovative workplace culture.

Developing inclusion skills is an ongoing process, and individuals can benefit from feedback and coaching to enhance their skills. In this chapter, we will discuss strategies for utilizing feedback and coaching to develop your inclusion skills.

Seeking Out Feedback
--------------------

Seeking out feedback from colleagues, supervisors, and other stakeholders can be a valuable way to identify areas for growth when it comes to inclusion. This can involve soliciting feedback through informal conversations or more formal feedback processes.

Being Open to Critique
----------------------

Being open to critique is essential for developing inclusion skills. It involves being receptive to constructive feedback, even when it is difficult to hear, and using that feedback as an opportunity for growth and development.

Working with a Coach or Mentor
------------------------------

Working with a coach or mentor can provide individuals with personalized support and guidance when it comes to developing inclusion skills. Coaches and mentors can help identify areas for growth, provide feedback and guidance, and offer resources and tools to support skill development.

Participating in Training Programs
----------------------------------

Participating in training programs focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion can be a valuable way to develop inclusion skills. These programs can provide individuals with a deeper understanding of different perspectives and experiences, as well as practical skills and strategies for communicating effectively across differences.

Practicing Self-Reflection
--------------------------

Self-reflection is an important component of developing inclusion skills. It involves taking time to reflect on one's own biases, assumptions, and perspectives, and working to understand how they may impact interactions with others.

Conclusion
----------

Developing inclusion skills is an ongoing process that requires intentional effort and practice. By seeking out feedback, being open to critique, working with a coach or mentor, participating in training programs, and practicing self-reflection, individuals can continue to enhance their skills and contribute to a more inclusive workplace culture. The key is to be proactive about seeking out opportunities for growth and development, to take feedback seriously, and to remain committed to ongoing learning and improvement.

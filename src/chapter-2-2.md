Inclusion is not just a buzzword, but a scientifically proven concept with significant benefits for individuals and organizations. In this chapter, we will explore the science behind inclusion, including how our brains process social information, and discuss why understanding this science is critical to building a more inclusive workplace culture.

The Science Behind Inclusion
----------------------------

Our brains are wired to process social information in a way that can lead to bias and discrimination. However, research has also shown that we have the ability to rewire our brains to be more inclusive. Some key findings from the science of inclusion include:

* Our brains process social information automatically and unconsciously, which can lead to biases and stereotypes.
* These biases and stereotypes can affect our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors towards others, leading to discrimination and exclusion.
* However, we have the ability to override these automatic processes through conscious effort and practice.
* By practicing inclusive behaviors and challenging our biases, we can rewire our brains to be more inclusive and reduce the impact of unconscious bias on our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

Why Understanding the Science of Inclusion Is Important
-------------------------------------------------------

Understanding the science of inclusion is critical to building a more inclusive workplace culture. When we understand how our brains process social information, we can recognize the potential for bias and discrimination and take steps to mitigate its impact. Some benefits of understanding the science of inclusion include:

* **Increased self-awareness**: Understanding the science of inclusion can help us become more aware of our own biases and how they may impact our interactions with others.
* **Improved communication**: When we understand the potential for bias and discrimination, we can communicate more effectively with colleagues from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.
* **Enhanced creativity and innovation**: By challenging our biases and seeking out diverse perspectives, we can foster creativity and innovation in the workplace.
* **Higher levels of engagement and job satisfaction**: Employees who feel included and valued are more likely to be engaged and satisfied with their jobs.

Conclusion
----------

Inclusion is not just a buzzword, but a scientifically proven concept with significant benefits for individuals and organizations. Understanding the science of inclusion, including how our brains process social information and the potential for bias and discrimination, is critical to building a more inclusive workplace culture. By practicing inclusive behaviors and challenging our biases, we can rewire our brains to be more inclusive and reduce the impact of unconscious bias on our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The benefits of understanding the science of inclusion include increased self-awareness, improved communication, enhanced creativity and innovation, and higher levels of engagement and job satisfaction.

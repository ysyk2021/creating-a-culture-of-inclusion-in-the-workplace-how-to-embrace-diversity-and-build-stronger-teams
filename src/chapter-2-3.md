Inclusion starts with each individual, and it's important to assess our personal approach to inclusion in the workplace. In this chapter, we will explore how to assess your personal approach to inclusion, including identifying your biases and understanding how they may impact your behavior towards others. We will also discuss strategies for overcoming biases and promoting inclusion in the workplace.

Assessing Your Personal Approach to Inclusion
---------------------------------------------

Assessing your personal approach to inclusion starts with understanding your own biases. Biases are automatic and unconscious, but by becoming more aware of them, you can take steps to mitigate their impact. Some strategies for assessing your personal approach to inclusion include:

1. **Identifying your biases**: Take time to reflect on your own biases and how they may impact your interactions with others. This could involve taking an implicit bias test or seeking feedback from colleagues.

2. **Examining your behaviors**: Pay attention to your own behaviors and interactions with colleagues. Are there certain groups of people with whom you tend to interact more or less? Do you tend to interrupt or dismiss certain colleagues more than others?

3. **Seeking out diverse perspectives**: Actively seek out diverse perspectives and experiences to help broaden your own understanding and challenge your biases.

4. **Being open to feedback**: Be open to receiving feedback from colleagues about your own behavior and biases. Use this feedback as an opportunity to grow and improve.

Overcoming Biases and Promoting Inclusion in the Workplace

2. **Building relationships with colleagues from diverse backgrounds**: Building strong relationships with colleagues from diverse backgrounds can help break down stereotypes and promote understanding.

3. **Using inclusive language**: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all colleagues, regardless of their backgrounds or identities.

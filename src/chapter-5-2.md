Maximizing inclusion skills in the workplace involves finding ways to apply those skills to one's job. In this chapter, we will discuss strategies for identifying opportunities to apply inclusion skills in the workplace.

Understanding How Inclusion Relates to Your Job
-----------------------------------------------

The first step in applying inclusion skills to one's job is to understand how those skills relate to one's specific role. This involves reflecting on the ways in which inclusion can enhance one's work, and identifying specific areas where inclusion skills can be applied.

Building Relationships with Colleagues

Building relationships with colleagues is an important way to apply inclusion skills in the workplace. This involves taking the time to get to know colleagues on a personal level, seeking out their perspectives and experiences, and working collaboratively to achieve common goals.

Seeking Out Opportunities to Collaborate Across Teams

Seeking out opportunities to collaborate across teams can also provide individuals with an opportunity to apply inclusion skills in the workplace. By working with individuals from different departments or functions, individuals can gain exposure to different perspectives and experiences, and develop more inclusive approaches to problem-solving.

Advocating for Inclusive Policies and Practices

Advocating for inclusive policies and practices is another valuable way to apply inclusion skills in the workplace. This involves speaking up when bias or exclusionary practices are present, proposing alternative solutions that promote diversity and inclusivity, and advocating for policies and practices that support a culture of inclusivity.

Embracing Diversity in Decision-Making
--------------------------------------

Embracing diversity in decision-making involves actively seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences when making decisions. This can involve soliciting input from colleagues who come from different backgrounds, considering the potential impact of decisions on different groups of stakeholders, and challenging assumptions and biases that may be present.
